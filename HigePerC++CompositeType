Got it — here’s a **clear, teaching-friendly explanation of C++ composite types**, with examples you can directly use in class.

---

## 🧱 What is a Composite Type in C++?

A **composite type** is a type that is **constructed from other types** (as opposed to a fundamental type like `int` or `double`).

In short:

> **Composite types group, reference, or organize multiple values together.**

---

## 📦 Main Categories of Composite Types

### 1️⃣ Arrays

A fixed-size collection of elements of the **same type**.

```cpp
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

**Key points**

* Size fixed at compile time
* Stored contiguously in memory
* No bounds checking

---

### 2️⃣ Pointers

Store the **address** of another object.

```cpp
int x = 10;
int* p = &x;
```

**Key points**

* Enables dynamic memory and indirection
* Essential for low-level control
* Can be dangerous if misused (dangling pointers)

---

### 3️⃣ References

An **alias** to an existing object.

```cpp
int x = 10;
int& ref = x;
```

**Key points**

* Must be initialized
* Cannot be reseated
* Safer than pointers in many cases

---

### 4️⃣ Structures (`struct`)

Group multiple variables of **different types**.

```cpp
struct Order {
    int id;
    char side;
    int price;
    int quantity;
};
```

**Key points**

* Members are public by default
* Used heavily in data modeling (e.g., match engines)

---

### 5️⃣ Classes (`class`)

Like `struct`, but with **encapsulation and behavior**.

```cpp
class Order {
public:
    int id;
    char side;
    int price;

    void print() const {
        cout << id << " " << side << " " << price << endl;
    }
};
```

**Key points**

* Members are private by default
* Supports OOP concepts
* Preferred in large systems

---

### 6️⃣ Unions

Different members **share the same memory**.

```cpp
union Value {
    int i;
    double d;
};
```

**Key points**

* Only one member is valid at a time
* Memory-efficient
* Rare in modern C++ (replaced by `std::variant`)

---

### 7️⃣ Enumerations (`enum`, `enum class`)

Define a set of named constants.

```cpp
enum class Side {
    Buy,
    Sell
};
```

**Key points**

* Improves readability
* `enum class` is strongly typed (recommended)

---

### 8️⃣ Standard Library Composite Types (Very Important)

#### `std::pair`

```cpp
pair<int, int> p = {1, 100};
```

#### `std::tuple`

```cpp
tuple<int, char, double> t(1, 'B', 99.5);
```

#### Containers

```cpp
vector<int> v;
map<int, Order> orderBook;
set<Order> orders;
```

## 🧠 Composite Types vs Fundamental Types

| Fundamental | Composite         |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| `int`       | `int[10]`         |
| `double`    | `struct`, `class` |
| `char`      | `vector<char>`    |
| `bool`      | `map<int, int>`   |

---

## 📈 Teaching Example (Match Engine Context)

```cpp
struct Order {
    int id;
    int price;
    int qty;
    int timestamp;
};
```

```cpp
struct CompareBuy {
    bool operator()(const Order& a, const Order& b) const {
        if (a.price != b.price) return a.price < b.price;
        return a.timestamp > b.timestamp;
    }
};
```

👉 Shows **struct + function object + STL container** working together.

## 🎯 Key Teaching Takeaways

* Composite types **model real-world entities**
* They enable **abstraction and scalability**
* STL containers are the **most practical composite types**
* Clean design beats clever code

## 🧪 Quick Quiz for Students

1. Why is `struct` often used in trading systems?
2. Difference between `struct` and `class`?
3. Why is `enum class` safer than `enum`?
4. When would you prefer a `vector` over an array?

If you want, I can:

* Create **slides**
* Design **homework exercises**
* Show **memory layout diagrams**
* Explain composite types specifically for **order books / engines**

Just say the word 🙂
